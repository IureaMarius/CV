\section{Experience}
\subsection{IOmundo} 01/10/2020 $\rightarrow$ current
\subsection{Job Title:} Software Engineer
\subsection{Industry:} Tourism
\subsubsection{Overview:}
Started out as a full-stack developer, working mostly on an client facing integrated booking engine built using Angular, and enhancing the WCF web services it relied on. Since this project finished, worked mostly on the back-end. Had to regularly talk with clients, and transcribe their end user features into strict specifications. Made my voice heard and had input into decisions about new projects.

\subsubsection{Tech Stack:} .NET, Angular
\subsubsection{Responsibilities:}
-learned Angular over the course of 2 weeks while discussing the project requirements

-ended up working on the Angular integrated booking engine and it's associated web services alone with no prior experience using Angular, and took the project from a small set of specifications and wireframes, to a functioning product, under constantly changing requirements, and new features being requested. Genuinely took ownership over this part of our product.

-ensured cross browser compatibility of our integrated booking engine through the use of polyfills

-created a bridge to convert our existing XML based API into a JSON based API, in order to more easily consume it from our Angular application

-found an issue in our content retrieval Umbraco controller that caused a big part of the content stored in Umbraco to be retrieved from the database, instead of the more efficient XML cache. After adding an Lucene search index, and making sure all of the calls tried to hit the cache before going to the database, reduced the load time of an average search that retrieved 200 services from about 90 seconds to less than 8 seconds.

-performed performance profiling and added optimizations to our webservices

-performed speed improvements by implementing asynchronous processing in some of our web services

-performed multiple extensions to our UmbracoCMS instance

-integrated the Concardis as a payment provider to our booking engine, in the angular application and in the backend ERP product

-worked on integrating Adyen as a payment provider in one of our client's systems

-added automatic image resizing and watermarking of uploaded images to our Umbraco CMS

-created automated tasks for rerunning our image resizing and watermarking proccess with different parameters on our existing dataset.

-helped create and run exports from our client's old system to our CMS

-had calls with our client, talking about requirements, managing expectations, and deciding on the final UX.

-worked on a web scraper that kept the data from our client's platform in sync with ours

-worked under a Agile Scrum methodology

-worked on our email templating and creation system

-took part in moving our existing source control system from SVN to Git, helped colleagues get familiar with using Git

-wrote integration and unit tests for some of our web services

-worked on changing our insurance business logic to accomodate COVID related changes in the HanseMerkur API

-provided support on a critical failure in our live systems, and developed and delivered a solution in record time

-dealt with the deploying of our client's application on the staging and on the live servers, manually, but also using Jenkins for automation

-found, reproduced, and fixed bugs in multiple projects

-helped collegues with pair programming, and collective code reviews

-took part in discussion deciding architectural choices for our new projects




\subsection{Bitdefender} 01/06/2020 $\rightarrow$ 01/10/2020
\subsection{Job Title:} Junior Software Engineer
\subsection{Industry:} Cybersecurity
\subsection{Department:} Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab
\subsubsection{Project Overview:}
The application is an internally used tool that deals with the analysis of logs created by other Bitdefender products: it filters out irrelevant events and gives the user tools to analyze the chain of events that led up to a malware detection event.
\subsubsection{Technologies used: Node.js, Express.js, JQuery, Bootstrap, AJAX, JSON}
\subsubsection{Responsibilities:}
-went through a 2-week learning program where I learned how to use Node.js and Express.js where I was familiarized the most commonly used Node packages

-refactored an existing codebase for a log processing and analysis utility

-modularized the application and made it comply with the code style guide

-rebuilt the complex filtering and preprocessing of the JSON files.

-substantially optimizing the filtering and lowered general load times across the application by rewriting the glob filtering modules and modules modeling the relations between events and detections

-took initiative in implementing lazy loading in order to decrease the size of the requests sent and received, drastically decreasing server and client load

-added support for a different type of log file

-implemented automatic detection of log file type and OS

\section{Education}
